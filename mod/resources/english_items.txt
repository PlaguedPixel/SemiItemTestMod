Peaceful

Bashful Shot
#BASHFUL_SHOT_SHORT_DESC
Travel Light
#BASHFUL_SHOT_LONG_DESC
These remarkably compatible musket balls prefer to keep to themselves, and don’t like other items getting in the way.

#GORGUN_HEAD_SHORT_DESC
Don't Lose It
#GORGUN_HEAD_LONG_DESC
This gruesome trinket shows complete mastery of Meduzi, the dreaded Gorgun, such that you can gleefully parade around her grizzly severed head.
While it retains her former power, such a display of barbarism will earn you no mercy from the already aggressive Gundead, and it may only be a matter of time until your own head is removed.

#PUFFBALL_SHORT_DESC
PLOOMPH
#PUFFBALL_LONG_DESC
A relative of the Fungun, this Puffball acts in much the same way when squeezed. Unlike it’s deadlier cousins, however, this Puffball does not have legs.
That makes this puffball sad sometimes, but he’s learned to live with it.
